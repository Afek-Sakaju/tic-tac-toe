### Here are a few features that were implemented in the game:

-   [x] **Scripting** : The utilization of _JavaScript_ script files within the client pages to enable page interaction when the user clicks/hovers on a button or element.
-   [x] **Animations and sound effects** : Incorporating effects when the user hovers or clicks on components, along with using keyframes animations and sound effects, significantly enhances the page's responsiveness.<br /> These additions contribute to a more immersive game experience.
